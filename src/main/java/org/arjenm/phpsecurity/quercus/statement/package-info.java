/**
 * Package of "Parse Tree Access"-enhanced Quercus Statement classes.
 *
 * The classes in this package don't really add anything to the base-classes from Quercus, they just offer
 * accessors to the main properties of the class they derive from.
 *
 * As such, you won't find much documentation on these classes (although, unfortunately, Quercus has little documentation as well).
